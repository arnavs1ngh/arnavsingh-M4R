Hi Arnav,

Apologies for forgetting to send these earlier. I had hand-scrawled some notes on your paper copy but rather than send that I’ve tried to summarise some points below.

Many of my notes are about the exposition in terms of defining variables, clarifying the setting etc.

- top of page 3, what is $\Pi_{\phi; n, s}$? This is not defined here.
- 1.2 Statement: is d the dimension of the output of f? Would it be simpler to present the proof for the case where d=1, and is it a relatively trivial extension to the proof if d>1?
- Bottom of p3, there exist $d\times s$ matrices $\{A_j\}_{j=1}^n$ and $b_j\in\mathbb{R}^d$
  - Are the A_j and b_j independent of f?
- Definitions in 1.3: it would be nice to show some examples of these definitions and try to build up a bit of intuition for what they mean
- (Idea for the proof) I am not sure what coordinatewise degree means. Is this the degree of the polynomial’s monomials?
- I think the notation for some objects is a bit confusing, and not made clearer by introducing ‘shorthand’ notation. e.g. $v_n(g, t)$: I think it is clearer to consistently use one notation. Related point: I don’t know what $v_m(g)(\mathbf{k})$ is meant to be in eq (3)
- Below ‘Instead construct the following’: Write $T: W_{r, s}^p([-1, 1]) \rightarrow …$
- Just above eq (4), $T(f)\psi$ coincides with $f$ on $[-1, 1]^s$ almost everywhere
- p6, equations just below ‘Going back to our key result…’. Are these equations referencing another result? Where do these come from?
- Bottom of p6 to top of p7, I don’t follow the equation below ‘we conclude that’. Is there a mistake with the $\mathbf{w}(b)$?

In general I think the story is not yet so clear. Probably tightening up a lot of the definitions etc. will help a lot, but there is also some part of the critical path that I am missing, particularly with the estimates using the polynomials $P_m(f)$ as highlighted above.

Best wishes,
Kevins
